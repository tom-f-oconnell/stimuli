- might make sense to move one of the configs from the choice repo (for
  odor_randomizer) to this repo, at least as an example, if not to also serve as
  the parameter file actually invoked by the choice code.

- use a service / another flag in return of defaults to only proceed with
  callbacks after parameters are all set?

POWER CYCLING ARDUINO SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT NOT RESET VALVES NOW (it should)
- is this an electronics issue w/ Wilson lab MOSFET driver? mechanism,
  otherwise?  my imagination?

- remove any dependencies on ROS? (for use on Windows, etc)
- provide alternate computer-side (python?) interface for setting configuration

- configurable support for diff kinds of triggers of pulse trains (high/low
  transitions, etc)? (for timing w/ external hardware)
  - gate input (idea from cyclops stimulator) & maybe otherwise just execute
    config continuously?

- utility to convert from pulsepal config format(s) to a config suitable here?
- likewise for "Presentation" description formats

- Maybe set immutable bit / otherwise make it hard for users to change
  configuration files in a directory, once that experiment is run. or store
  another copy elsewhere, which I guess I already do...
