 - rename odor_randomizer to stimuli_randomizer, if I can provide some means of
   also specifying other stimuli in the same framework (and then map odors to
   pins through that mechanism)

- even if not implementing a richer GUI w/ support for selecting / manipulating
  ROIs, implement deletion for closest to cursor?
